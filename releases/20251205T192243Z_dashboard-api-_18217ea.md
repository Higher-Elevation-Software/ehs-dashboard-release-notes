# Refined Chemical Amount Calculations for Regulatory Reporting

**Component:** dashboard-api  
**Date:** 2025-12-05  
**Environment:** staging

We have enhanced the methodology for calculating chemical amounts, providing a more robust and precise selection for reporting. This update standardizes how chemical data is processed by prioritizing the `high` value from `constsum` when present and non-zero, seamlessly integrating with the established `amount` value when `high` is not applicable. Additionally, we have refined our emissions calculations by streamlining the process, ensuring constituent weights are directly represented without redundant multiplication.
