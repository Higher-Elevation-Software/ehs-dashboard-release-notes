# Enhanced HAP Single Emissions Data and Compliance Reporting

**Date:** Feb 12, 2026  
**Category:** Improvement

HAP Single emissions data processing and reporting have been improved for greater clarity and accuracy. Users will observe more consistent identification of HAP Single, with detailed constituent information like CAS numbers available for drilldown. Compliance calculations now reliably present only the highest-emitting HAP constituent per period, aligning with regulatory standards.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
