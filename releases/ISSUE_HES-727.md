# Streamlined Purchase Request Emails

**Date:** Feb 24, 2026  
**Category:** Improvement

The system for trial users to request a purchase has been updated. Each trial user can now submit one purchase request per company, with subsequent attempts reliably indicating that a request has already been sent. This ensures clearer management of purchase inquiries and a more consistent experience.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
