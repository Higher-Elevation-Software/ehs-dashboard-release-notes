# Refined Chemical Amount Determination for Emissions Reporting

**Component:** dashboard-api  
**Date:** 2025-12-08  
**Environment:** production

We have updated the methodology for determining chemical amounts, now consistently prioritizing the upper bound value for chemical composition where applicable, or utilizing the primary recorded amount. This enhancement refines data processing for emissions calculations, streamlining how constituent weights are incorporated into your regulatory reporting for greater clarity.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
