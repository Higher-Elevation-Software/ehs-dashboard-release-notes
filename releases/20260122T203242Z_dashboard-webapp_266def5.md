# Enhanced PDF Generation Stability and Security

**Date:** Jan 22, 2026  
**Category:** Security

We have updated our underlying PDF generation library to improve the reliability and security of your exported documents. This update includes enhanced protections against potential vulnerabilities and refines how content, such as text and images, is rendered. You may observe more consistent formatting and document integrity in various PDF outputs across the platform.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
