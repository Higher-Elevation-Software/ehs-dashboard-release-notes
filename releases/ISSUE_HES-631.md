# Improved Visibility of All Safety Data Sheets

**Date:** Dec 12, 2025  
**Category:** Improvement

Previously, some users could only view a limited number of their Safety Data Sheets (SDS) in certain lists. We have updated the system to ensure that all SDS documents are fully visible, providing a comprehensive view of your chemical library. This enhancement improves the completeness and reliability of your compliance information.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
