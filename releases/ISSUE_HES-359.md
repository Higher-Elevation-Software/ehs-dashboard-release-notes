# Improved Dashboard Table Refresh After Form Saves

**Date:** Jan 09, 2026  
**Category:** Improvement

The dashboard table now refreshes automatically immediately after you save a form. This ensures that any new processline or updated information is visible in the table without needing a manual refresh, improving data consistency and workflow efficiency.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
