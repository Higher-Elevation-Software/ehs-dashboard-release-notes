# Enhanced User Facility and Active Company Management

**Date:** Feb 11, 2026  
**Category:** Improvement

We've refined how your assigned facilities are determined and displayed, ensuring greater consistency across the platform, especially for users with company-wide access. Facilities in user profiles and selection menus are now reliably sorted by name. Active company identification has also been improved for better accuracy and validity.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
