# Clearer Display for Aliased Chemical Reference Information

**Date:** Jan 06, 2026  
**Category:** Improvement

The `aliased_to` field for chemical reference information now provides a more structured display. It consistently shows key details like `id`, `partno`, and `name`, improving clarity and ease of understanding for related chemical records.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
