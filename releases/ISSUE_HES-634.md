# Improved SDS Document Access and Chemical Reference Information

**Date:** Jan 27, 2026  
**Category:** Improvement

Accessing attached Safety Data Sheets (SDS) within chemical reference information is now more direct, with a dedicated URL provided for each document. This enhancement also streamlines how aliased part numbers are processed and displayed, improving overall data clarity and loading efficiency.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
