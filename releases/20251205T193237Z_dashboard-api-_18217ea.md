# Refined Chemical Amount and Emissions Calculations

**Component:** dashboard-api  
**Date:** 2025-12-05  
**Environment:** staging

We have refined how chemical amounts are determined within the platform, implementing a standardized approach that prioritizes the most precise available data for composition. This enhancement further strengthens the consistency and reliability of your chemical data processing and regulatory reporting. Additionally, emissions calculations have been streamlined by optimizing the logic for constituent weight, eliminating redundant processing steps.
