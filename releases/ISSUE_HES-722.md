# Improved Admin Health Report with Focused Summaries

**Date:** Feb 19, 2026  
**Category:** Improvement

The administrative health report has been streamlined to provide clearer, more focused summaries of user activity. The report now includes sorted lists of elevated administrators and those with recent updates, enhancing oversight. Detailed company and session information has been removed in favor of high-level counts, focusing on essential administrative data.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
