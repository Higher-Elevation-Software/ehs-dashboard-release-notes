# Always Current Chemical and Metric Data

**Date:** Feb 10, 2026  
**Category:** Improvement

We've updated the system to ensure that chemical management data, including delegation details, process limits, and constant sums, is always current. Additionally, metric name edit forms will now display the freshest information. This enhancement guarantees users consistently see the most up-to-date data for critical EHS compliance tasks, improving overall reliability.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
