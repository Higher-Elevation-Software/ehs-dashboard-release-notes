# Trial User Facility Management Actions Updated

**Date:** Feb 24, 2026  
**Category:** Improvement

For trial users, the "Add New Facility" button is now disabled, clearly indicating the need to upgrade for full access. Behind the scenes, we've optimized how facility types are loaded, enhancing the consistency and responsiveness of facility-related actions.

_More details or escalation info here as appropriate._
